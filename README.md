https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-projects-for-beginners-to-practice-html-and-css-skills/

My first website will be a tribute page for uh, let's do uhhh, York from Deadly Premonition. It will include a picture of York at the top of the page, perhaps multiple pictures. This will be followed by a description of York's achievements, personality, fun quotes, etc. 
skills to practice: 
background colors, font family selection, img insertion and alignment, maybe try flexboxes, and similar skills
