                <ul>   
                <li>Who is Francis York Morgan? He is the charmingly-uncharming protagonist in the hit game, Deadly Premonition. 
            He has worked as an FBI agent for years, cracking various gruesome and horrific cases all across the United States.
            One day, he is called to investigate a murder case of a teenage girl in Greenvale, Washington. After he arrives and performs 
            an autopsy, he realizes that this case is but one part of a string of cases that he has been solving for years that involve
            mysterious red seeds. Thus, his brief trip to rainy Washington becomes a much longer ordeal. </li>
              
               <li> 
            Francis York Morgan is endearingly awkward and uninterested in social cues, landing him in various comical situations and saying 
            various comical things (comical to the audience at least). He has a keen fascination with cinema and is prone to reminiscing about his
            favorite and not-so-favorite films he has seen or wants to see with his alter ego, Zach. </li>

        </ul>
